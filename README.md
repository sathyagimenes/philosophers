# Philosophers
42's philosophers project | Threads and mutexes


Eat, Sleep, Spaghetti, repeat. This project is about learning how threads work by precisely timing a group of philosophers on when to pick up forks and eat spaghetti without dying from hunger. The objective is to solve the [dining philosophers problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dining_philosophers_problem) implementing a mutithreading solution.
